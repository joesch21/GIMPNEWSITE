    <h2>Proposal for Implementing NFT-Based Voting Protocol</h2>
    
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>This professional proposal outlines the implementation of a voting protocol for our token holders using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The primary aim is to empower the community with decision-making capabilities by assigning voting rights based on NFT ownership, ensuring fairness and decentralized governance.</p>
    
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>We propose adopting an <strong>NFT-based voting system</strong> where each NFT owned by a token holder grants <strong>one voting right</strong>. This system ensures that governance decisions reflect the collective voice of the community and encourages active participation in critical organizational decisions.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <p><strong>Voting Rights:</strong> Each NFT represents <strong>one vote</strong>. Voting power is non-transferable without transferring the NFT.</p>
    <p><strong>Proposal Creation:</strong> Any holder with a minimum of <strong>one NFT</strong> can propose a vote. Proposals can include but are not limited to treasury management, protocol upgrades, and strategic partnerships.</p>
    <p><strong>Quorum Requirements:</strong> A proposal will only be considered valid if at least <strong>10% of the total NFTs in circulation</strong> participate.</p>
    <p><strong>Voting Period:</strong> The voting period will last for <strong>seven days</strong> from the start of each proposal.</p>
    <p><strong>Passing Criteria:</strong> A proposal will pass if it receives a majority of <strong>50% +1</strong> votes in favor based on participating NFTs.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>This proposal seeks to create a fair and inclusive voting protocol using NFTs, reinforcing our commitment to decentralized governance.</p>
