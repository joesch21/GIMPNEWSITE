    <h2>Proposal for Implementing NFT-Based Voting Protocol</h2>
    
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>This professional proposal outlines the implementation of a voting protocol for our token holders using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The primary aim is to empower the community with decision-making capabilities by assigning voting rights based on NFT ownership, ensuring fairness and decentralized governance.</p>
    
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>We propose adopting an NFT-based voting system where each NFT owned by a token holder grants one voting right. This system ensures that governance decisions reflect the collective voice of the community and encourages active participation in critical organizational decisions.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <p>Voting Rights: Each NFT represents one vote. Voting power is non-transferable without transferring the NFT.</p>
    <p>Proposal Creation: Any holder with a minimum of one NFT can propose a vote. Proposals can include but are not limited to treasury management, protocol upgrades, and strategic partnerships.</p>
    <p>Quorum Requirements: A proposal will only be considered valid if at least 10% of the total NFTs in circulation participate.</p>
    <p>Voting Period: The voting period will last for seven days from the start of each proposal.</p>
    <p>Passing Criteria: A proposal will pass if it receives a majority of 50% +1 votes in favor based on participating NFTs.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>This proposal seeks to create a fair and inclusive voting protocol using NFTs, reinforcing our commitment to decentralized governance.</p>

    <h2>Proposal for a Sustainable Floating Rate Staking Reward Contract for GCC Token</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This proposal outlines the development of a floating rate staking reward smart contract designed to provide sustainable token rewards for NFT holders who stake their NFTs.</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>Sustainable reward distribution based on transaction volume.</p>
    <p>Fair allocation among NFT stakers.</p>
    <p>Floating rate reward structure.</p>
    <p>Reserve buffer for sustainability.</p>
    <p>Encourage long-term participation.</p>

    <h3>Reward Calculation Model - EXAMPLE </h3>
    <p>The staking rewards will be derived from the 1% transaction fee collected from daily GCC token trades.</p>
    <p>Total NFTs Staked: 100</p>
    <p>Daily GCC Volume: 1000 GCC</p>
    <p>Transaction Fee: 1% (10 GCC)</p>
    <p>Reserve Buffer: 20% (2 GCC)</p>
    <p>Net Daily Rewards Pool: 8 GCC</p>
    <p>Hourly Reward Pool: 0.3333 GCC</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p>Staking Mechanism: Users can stake their NFTs to earn rewards.</p>
    <p>Floating Rate Distribution: Rewards based on daily transaction volume.</p>
    <p>Reserve Buffer Management: A portion of the rewards reserved for sustainability.</p>
    <p>Claiming Rewards: Users can claim rewards anytime.</p>

    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <p>Key security features will include:</p>
    <p>Using OpenZeppelin libraries for security.</p>
    <p>Reentrancy protection mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Pause function for emergencies.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This proposal aims to create a fair and sustainable floating rate staking reward system for GCC token holders, balancing reward distribution with market performance.</p>
